# Task

The following repository's history is broken :(

We need to fix it!

## Steps

1. Fork and clone [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/TASK-Masterclass-M1-Git).
2. Run a `git log` to see the history of the repository.
3. Try different formats like `git log --oneline`.
4. Fix the history according to the output `git log` (you will see the instructions in the body of the commits).
5. Remove all instructions from the body of the commits once all fixes were completed.
6. Add `.venv` to `.gitignore` and start untracking it (add a new commit for this fix).
7. Push your changes to your repo using `git push --force`.

Your history should look something like this at the end:

1. First commit: includes `gitignore` changes
2. Add typer to dependencies
3. Add cli scaffold
4. Add greet functionality
5. Add help menu
6. Untrack `.venv`
